I am an Associate Professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Criminal Justice at Indiana University Bloomington. Here is my [CV](jrbrauer_cv_2023.06.12.pdf).

You can find some of my course materials and blog entries at the [Reluctant Criminologists](https://reluctantcriminologists.com/), a collaborative website that I co-author with [Jake Day](https://www.jacobcday.com/).
